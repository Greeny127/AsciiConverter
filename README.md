# AsciiConverter
Converts a video to ascii characters and displays in real time on your console

Used in a console by default

eg - `main.py C:/User/Name/Desktop/video.mp4 True 68 100`


Can be refactored easily to work without command line args
360 width = actual 360p (Thats a lot of charecters displayed very fast so not reccomended for low end computers)
